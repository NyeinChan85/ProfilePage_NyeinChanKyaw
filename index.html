            <p class="section-content">As the IT Manager at the Economic Analysis and Policy Division within the United Nations's Department of Economic and Social Affairs, I bear the responsibility of leading and overseeing IT projects and services that are in alignment with the division's mission and objectives. With over 13 years of experience in the IT industry, I've held diverse roles, including IT manager, developer, business analyst, and consultant, serving a wide range of organizations and clients.

My expertise encompasses various domains, including data analytics, web development, database design, and programming, as well as IT service management, technical writing, and user support. In addition to multiple certifications, I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in program evaluation and data analytics at Arizona State University (ASU), a career certificate in data analysis with R from Duke University, a professional certificate in Data Science (Python) from IBM, and participating in an executive education program at Columbia Business School. My true passion lies in harnessing technology and data to tackle intricate challenges and drive positive outcomes.</p>
